This is a small program I wrote quickly to do a histogram of the digits in pi.

It's written in about half an hour, and most of the time was spent getting the
formatting of the output to not be too bad.

It will count the digits in any other input too - and if you give it some
random text-file (or for that matter, a binary file), it will just skip all the
stuff that isn't digits. [I tried feeding it the a.out that I built]. 

Feel free to use for any reasonable purpose...
